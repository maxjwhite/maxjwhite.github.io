  Air quality has been one of the most significant environmental issues throughout modern history. The industrial revolution, recent population growth, and infrastructure development have led to increasing concentrations of pollutants in the Earth’s Atmosphere. Research surrounding air quality focuses on measuring and understanding the pollutants that we release into the air we breath. Getting a better understanding of how they are released, how we interact with them gives us a better understanding of the effects on long term health, the environment, and the economy. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 7 million premature deaths occur annually due to air pollution. The importance of this subject stems from the fact that everyone is affected by air quality, and developments that are discovered through this work have the potential to benefit everyone. Communities, governments, and corporations all stand to benefit from improvements in air quality analysis and the applications of the work are varied  with a high potential to be of use in areas we have not yet explored. In addition, understanding air quality patterns can inform city planning, disaster preparedness, and policy design. By focusing on air quality analysis, our research contributes to a growing global effort to improve quality of life and build more sustainable futures. 

  The issue of air quality touches a wide range of stakeholders, from individuals and families to entire industries and national governments. At the most vulnerable level are groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. These groups are disproportionately affected by poor air quality and they stand to benefit the most from improvements in air quality analysis. We also have to consider the healthcare systems that treat and deal with the consequences of poor air quality as the volume of pollutants in the air increases, the number of hospitalizations due to said pollutants increases as well, driving up the cost of treatment and increasing the stress placed on the healthcare system. In addition to those that deal with the aftermath of these pollutants, we also have to consider the sources and the stakeholders who are actually responsible for releasing these pollutants into the atmosphere. We all play a small part in this, but larger corporations are largely responsible and are the main drivers of air pollution, so it is important to consider how our work might affect the work that these larger corporations are doing and how we can enact change without stepping on too many toes. Building upon this point further, other stakeholders involved are environmental advocacy groups and researchers who rely on air quality analysis to make informed recommendations and push for systemic change. And, even technology companies are affected, as innovations in monitoring sensors, predictive modeling, and clean energy all play a role in addressing this issue. The scope of air quality means that nearly every sector of society has some level of involvement or responsibility. The implications are global in scale but are often felt most acutely at the local and community level.

  The most obvious challenge that the industry currently faces is climate change. The effects of climate change have been felt by everyone and in recent years it has become an increasingly larger issue that needs to be addressed. The EPA has determined that pollutants released into the atmosphere, largely due to human activity, has been driving climate change and while significant progress has been made in measuring and addressing air quality, there is still lots of room for improvement. Some existing solutions include standards and regulations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which is used to set the standard for acceptable pollutant levels. These standards are important to consider when we are attempting to address climate change, which starts at adjusting the volume of pollutants we release into the atmosphere.This data is collected through a collection of monitoring stations and satellite data which work in conjunction to improve our understanding of pollutant sources and how they spread. Despite these developments, there are still challenges with coverage, especially in areas that have less available resources and are underdeveloped. Additionally, there are still gaps in the available information which restricts the ability to anticipate high pollutant concentrations and thus restricts the ability to make predictions. These gaps underscore the need for new approaches that leverage data science, machine learning, and open data to generate more precise, actionable insights. The nature of this issue is at the intersection of government and policy, individual behaviors, and corporation activity, and thus it requires a combined effort from all parties and stakeholders in order to properly address these issues. 

  Our project is designed to explore these opportunities by conducting an air quality analysis using modern data-driven methods. The goal is to evaluate air quality trends, identify hotspots, and highlight potential correlations between pollution and public health or socioeconomic factors. The purpose of this is to hopefully identify trends and patterns which we can use to support arguments in favor of action and change to address climate change. Our team will begin by collecting data from sources such as the EPA, World Health Organization, or any other open source data made available online in order to get a comprehensive foundation to build our models and analysis upon. The focus will be on Colorado, but there will also be models created that examine Air Quality trends at the national level as well. We will then analyze this data using exploratory and statistical methods, with a focus on visualizations that reveal patterns across time and space. Machine learning methods may also be applied to test predictive modeling of air quality in specific regions. Another area of interest will be comparing urban and rural differences, as well as examining how policy interventions have historically influenced air quality outcomes. By keeping the project flexible but structured, the team can adjust the analysis as new data or insights emerge. The hope is that our work can help contribute to the pool of research being conducted in order to address climate change. 

  The ultimate purpose of this project is to serve as practice in data analytics, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and data mining as a process. This also serves as an exercise in developing domain knowledge over the subject we are working on, which is also part of the data mining process. Climate change is one of today's most pressing issues and by producing a structured analysis and highlighting areas where improvements are needed, this project has the potential to provide value to policymakers, researchers, and communities. Our process must begin with a strong foundation of domain knowledge. By examining the intersection of related domains, our project will bring a new perspective in this field of study. The hope is that by investigating the relationship between human activity and air quality we can get a little bit of a better understanding of how human activity relates to climate change. At the end of the project, we hope to present not only descriptive results but also actionable recommendations based on the data. This might take the form of identifying regions that require improved monitoring, high/low risk areas, or developing models to help predict where at risk areas might form. Ensuring that our atmosphere is in good health is something that we are all invested in and something we all should be in support of, but there are always obstacles that get in our way and no solution is ever perfect. Ultimately, this project represents a step toward applying data-driven techniques to one of the greatest challenges of our time, while simultaneously strengthening our abilities as data scientists.
