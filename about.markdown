### **Shugavaneshwar Rajan**




Curious mind, tech enthusiast, and Data Science grad student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I’m interested in machine learning, cloud technologies, and building real-time systems that solve practical problems. I also enjoy mentoring peers, exploring new ideas, and working on projects that mix creativity with impact. Outside of academics, you’ll usually find me experimenting with tech, reading, or trying out new food spots.
