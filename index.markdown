# Project Overview
### Research Summary
This project explores air quality trends by analyzing environmental data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential impacts of pollutants on public health and the environment. Using data mining and statistical methods, we clean, visualize, and cluster air quality indicators to uncover meaningful insights. Our goal is to provide an accessible analysis that highlights problem areas, supports informed decision-making, and raises awareness of the importance of air quality in shaping sustainable communities. The project focuses it's scope on Colorado data, but the applications will be tested on a larger National scale as well.

### Research Questions
1. Over the years, what are the trends in AQI over a specific area, and what trends are the key pollutant levels? 
2. Which pollutants(CO, Pb, Ozone, SO2, NO2, PM10, PM5) have made the air quality in each area the worst?
3. Is there any correlation between meteorological factors like humidity, wind speed, and AQI levels?
4. Can we use past data to identify any patterns, allowing us to predict the future AQI for a specific location?
5. Is there any difference between urban, suburban, and rural areas for AQI?  
6. What is the impact of AQI in any special events, like wildfires 
7. Which cities consistently experience hazardous AQI levels
8. Do cities located near the sea experience better AQI due to the cooling effects of sea breezes compared to inland cities with similar populations?
9. Can we find any clustering of AQI patterns that identify groups of cities with similar pollution?
10. Is there any relation between AQI and industrial zones, and how much does AQI differ between residential and industrial areas?
